1.What is an algorithm?

2.Explain linear and non linear data structures with example.

3.Mention some javascript array method?

4.
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
let arr1 = [6,7,8,9,10]
let arr2 = [11,12,13,14,15]

merge three arrays using JS array method.

5.Print the result
let arr = [2,5,7,4,6,1]
let result = arr.some(item => item > 8)
let result2 = arr.some(item => item % 3 == 0)

console.log(result) 
console.log(result2) 

***************************************************************************
6.Find output?
let arr = [2,5,7,4,6,1]
let result = arr.includes(4)
let result2 = arr.includes(9)

console.log(result) 
console.log(result2) 

7.
let arr1 = ['This','is','so','awesome']
let result2 = arr1.join(' ') // giving space as a seprator
let result3 = arr1.join('-') // giving - as a seprator

console.log(result2)  
console.log(result3) 

8.What is stack in data structure. Give some example

9.Mention the operations in stack?

10.What is Queue?
// queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. 

11.List some Queue real-life applications 
//Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling etc.
In real life scenario, Call Center phone systems uses Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive i.e First come first served.

12.Mention the operations in Queue data structure
//The process to add an element into queue is called Enqueue and the process of removal of an element from queue is called Dequeue.

13.What are the operations that can be performed on a data-structures?
//Following operations can be performed â€“
 Insertion: Adding a new data item.
Deletion: Deleting the existing data item.
Traversal: Accessing each data item.
Searching: Finding a particular data item.
Sorting: Arranging the data item in a particular sequence.
